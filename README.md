## Installation
The code is built using Python 3.10, and can be run under any environment with Python 3.8 and above. We require PyTorch >= 2.2.0 and CUDA >= 12.0 (It may run with lower versions, but we have not tested it).

We recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and setting up an environment:

    conda create --name cogact python=3.10

Next, clone our repo and install the required packages:

    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/CogACT
    cd CogACT
    pip install -e .

If you need to use the traning code, please also install the [Flash Attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention):

    # Training additionally requires Flash-Attention 2 (https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)
    pip install packaging ninja

    # Verify Ninja --> should return exit code "0"
    ninja --version; echo $?

    # Install Flash Attention 2
    # =>> If you run into difficulty, try `pip cache remove flash_attn` first
    pip install "flash-attn==2.5.5" --no-build-isolation
## Getting Started
We release three CogACT models with different model sizes, including [Small](https://huggingface.co/CogACT/CogACT-Small), [Base](https://huggingface.co/CogACT/CogACT-Base) and [Large](https://huggingface.co/CogACT/CogACT-Large). Checkpoints, configs, and model cards are availabel on [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/CogACT). Refer to the code below for the minimal inference:

    from PIL import Image
    from vla import load_vla
    import torch

    model = load_vla(
          'CogACT/CogACT-Base',                 # choose from [CogACT-Small, CogACT-Base, CogACT-Large] or the local path
          load_for_training=False, 
          action_model_type='DiT-B',              # choose from ['DiT-S', 'DiT-B', 'DiT-L'] to match the model weight
          future_action_window_size=15,
        )                                 
    # about 30G Memory in fp32; 
    
    # (Optional) use "model.vlm = model.vlm.to(torch.bfloat16)" to load vlm in bf16
    
    model.to('cuda:0').eval()

    image: Image.Image = <input_your_image>     
    prompt = "move sponge near apple"           # input your prompt
    
    # Predict Action (7-DoF; un-normalize for RT-1 google robot data, i.e., fractal20220817_data)
    actions, _ = model.predict_action(
              image,
              prompt,
              unnorm_key='fractal20220817_data', # input your unnorm_key of the dataset
              cfg_scale = 1.5,                   # cfg from 1.5 to 7 also performs well
              use_ddim = True,                   # use DDIM sampling
              num_ddim_steps = 10,               # number of steps for DDIM sampling
            )

    # results in 7-DoF actions of 16 steps with shape [16, 7]

Alternatively, you can use batch inference function ``predict_action_batch`` from [vla/cogactvla.py](./vla/cogactvla.py) to accelerate inference in the simulator. For our ``Adaptive Action Ensemble`` strategy, please refer to [adaptive_ensemble.py](./evaluation/adaptive_ensemble.py).

## Fully Fine-Tuning
To fully fine-tune the pretrained models, we use PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel ([FSDP](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html)). The training script used is from [Prismatic VLMs](https://github.com/TRI-ML/prismatic-vlms).
We recommend using fully finetune on your dataset instead of LoRA, because the model with fully finetuning performs better in a shorter training time. Empirically. Fully finetuning the pretrained model for around 30 epochs already yields good results. Pretrained models can be download from our [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/CogACT/CogACT-Base) or by passing the model_id to the training scripts for automatic download.

**Download from our [Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/CogACT/CogACT-Base), using CogACT-Base for an example. (Optional)**

    # Change directory to your base model PATH
    cd <your_base_model_path>

    # Make sure you have git-lfs installed (https://git-lfs.com)
    git lfs install

    # Download checkpoint (30 GB)
    git clone https://huggingface.co/CogACT/CogACT-Base

You can also pass the model_id (e.g., `CogACT/CogACT-Base`) to the training scripts for automatic download. (Seeing below)

Next, create a [Hugging Face user access token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/security-tokens) and export the token value.

```bash
# export the HuggingFace user access token token
export HF_TOKEN = hf_..
```

Then launch the training script. We use one node with 8 A100 GPUs as an example.
```bash
torchrun --standalone --nnodes 1 --nproc-per-node 8 scripts/train.py \
  --pretrained_checkpoint <model_id/local_path_to_model,e.g,"CogACT/CogACT-Base"> \
  --vla.type prism-dinosiglip-224px+oxe+diffusion \
  --vla.data_mix <data_mix_option,e.g,"bridge"> \
  --vla.expected_world_size 8 \
  --vla.global_batch_size 256 \
  --vla.per_device_batch_size 32 \
  --vla.learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --data_root_dir <path_to_dataset_dir> \
  --run_root_dir <path_to_log/checkpoint_dir> \                 
  --run_id <optional_run_id_for_wandb> \
  --image_aug <True_or_False> \
  --wandb_project <your_wandb_project> \
  --wandb_entity <your_wandb_entity> \
  --save_interval <num_of_steps_to_save_checkpoint> \
  --repeated_diffusion_steps 8 \
  --future_action_window_size 15 \
  --action_model_type DiT-B \
  --is_resume False
```
More customized training settings and changes can be made in [`conf/vla.py`](conf/vla.py) by modifying and registering a new VLA type. If you want to resume from a checkpoint instead of starting training from scratch, please set `is_resume=True`. Note that you also need to set `--resume_step` and `--resume_epoch` to match the checkpoint, and the optimizer in the checkpoint also needs to be loaded.

To finetune on datasets belong to [Open X-Embodiment (OXE)](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/), you can download them from [OXE](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/) and change the ``vla.data_mix`` to the corresponding name. To finetune on your own customized data, please follow the instruction [(rlds_dataset_builder)](https://github.com/kpertsch/rlds_dataset_builder) for converting your data to RLDS format. The actions should be the deltas of end effector ``EEF Delta XYZ (3) + Roll-Pitch-Yaw (3) + Gripper Open/Close (1)``. Once your customized data is ready, place the customized data directly under the ``<data_root_dir>/custom_finetuning/1.0.0`` directory. Then set ``vla.data_mix="custom_finetuning"``.

## Training CogACT from Scratch
You can start the trainging from the weights of [OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla) for greater efficiency. Please follow the instruction of [OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla) to download their weights:

    # From OpenVLA repo
    # Change directory to your base model checkpoints folder
    cd <PATH TO BASE MODEL CHECKPOINTS DIR>

    # Download checkpoint (30 GB) -- may take a few minutes
    git clone git@hf.co:openvla/openvla-7b-prismatic

    # If the command above did not download the full checkpoint,
    # manually fetch it via git Large File Storage (LFS)
    # Note: You may have to configure an SSH key for this to work
    cd openvla-7b-prismatic
    git lfs fetch --all

The data of [Open X-Embodiment (OXE)](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/) can be download following [OXE](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/) and [OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla). Then launch the training script. We use one node with 8 A100 GPUs as an example.

```bash
torchrun --standalone --nnodes 1 --nproc-per-node 8 scripts/train.py \
  --pretrained_checkpoint openvla-7b-prismatic/checkpoints/step-295000-epoch-40-loss=0.2200.pt \
  --vla.type prism-dinosiglip-224px+oxe+diffusion \
  --vla.data_mix oxe_magic_soup_plus_minus \
  --vla.expected_world_size 8 \
  --vla.global_batch_size 256 \
  --vla.per_device_batch_size 32 \
  --vla.learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --data_root_dir <path_to_dataset_dir> \
  --run_root_dir <path_to_log/checkpoint_dir> \                 
  --run_id <optional_run_id_for_wandb> \
  --image_aug <True_or_False> \
  --wandb_project <your_wandb_project> \
  --wandb_entity <your_wandb_entity> \
  --save_interval <num_of_steps_to_save_checkpoint> \
  --repeated_diffusion_steps 8 \
  --future_action_window_size 15 \
  --action_model_type DiT-B \
  --is_resume False
```
You can also start training from PrismaticVLM and simply ignore the ``--pretrained_checkpoint``. However, it will take longer to converge.

## Evaluation in SIMPLER
In this section, we provide a minimal evaluation for our models in [SIMPLER](https://simpler-env.github.io/). First, please follow the instruction of [SimplerEnv](https://github.com/simpler-env/SimplerEnv) to install the simulation environment. Next, add our [./sim_cogact](./sim_cogact) to [SimplerEnv/simpler_env/policies](https://github.com/simpler-env/SimplerEnv/tree/main/simpler_env/policies).
```bash
cp ./sim_cogact <your_path_to_simpler>/simpler_env/policies -r
```
Then add a new policy model in [SimplerEnv/simpler_env/main_inference.py](https://github.com/simpler-env/SimplerEnv/blob/main/simpler_env/main_inference.py) as below:

    elif args.policy_model == "cogact":
        from simpler_env.policies.sim_cogact import CogACTInference
        assert args.ckpt_path is not None
        model = CogACTInference(
            saved_model_path=args.ckpt_path,  # e.g., CogACT/CogACT-Base
            policy_setup=args.policy_setup,
            action_scale=args.action_scale,
            action_model_type='DiT-B',
            cfg_scale=1.5                     # cfg from 1.5 to 7 also performs well
        )
After that, you can modify and launch the scripts in ``sim_cogact/scripts`` like:
```bash
cd <your_path_to_simpler>
bash simpler_env/policies/sim_cogact/scripts/cogact_put_in_drawer_visual_matching.sh
```
